The following might happen if you bleed the mods: \n\
1. Miss tech tree objects, which make units unable to produce and crafters unable to appear. \n\
2. Mods clash, which means Creator II or other mods would have content errors\n\
3. Saves broken, which means load and unload several mods would destroy the campaign game.\n\n\
If you insisted that mods be loaded together, your campaign could be destroyed and your tech tree would miss or swap places by mistakes.\n\

9527independent=[#fffc65]Independent Edition Introduction
independent_txt=[#2DC3D5]\n\
Rewrites all things in Surphlo in the mod.\n\
No longer depends on vanilla research tree.\n\
Becomes Independent.\n\
If you see any blocks banned,\n\
That must be the vanilla things you have unlocked before.\n\
When you want to use your vanilla schematics,\n\
You need to unlock both CT and vanilla research\n\
Of course you also need to tap the bottom Unlock Vanilla Schematics\n\
Now you need more time to load on mobile,\n\
Because over 300 things need to be defined again.




#剧情需要翻译一下 谢谢
9527JuQing =Background 

JuQing_txt=[#b2c9a1]( The following is just made up for the fictions)\n\
\n\
[#d9acc3]Anukenese:\n\
[#ffffff]Anukenese is a kind of consciousness organism which consist of soul, energy and data. \n\
They do not have real bodies.\n\
They can convert between the fantasy and the entities, and can be suited to any environments.\n\
They have a special reproduction way. No difference between male and female. \n\
They take in the technical energy and to give birth to a baby,\n\
Just breed a large number of their own technical energy, then, another Anukenese is given birth to.\n\
However. after that they will have a weak period. But taking in the technical energy will cure them.\n\
Each of them has their own, but all the consciousness are almost whole. You are in me therefore I am in you.\n\
They do not have privacy, or they do not know what the meaning of "privacy" is.\n\
\n\
[#d9acc3]Surphlo:\n\
[#ffffff]The starter of Anukenese. Anukenese used their intelligence to invent all kinds of technology for their own reproduction.\n\
\n\
[#d9acc3]Creator II: Origin\n\
[#ffffff]Anukenese had been researching a way to travel around the universe .\n\
Finally, they called it Planetary Launch Terminal.\n\
It could launch the energy body of Anukenese as a special ray to other planet and colonize it.\n\
\n\
While researching, Anukenese were fighting with other monsters in the Serpulo. When they had killed a strong battle machine, they found a mysterious energy fragment.\n\
By researching, they found that it was this fragment that makes the weak battle machine strength quickly and get the extreme battle abilities.\n\
Also, the fragment was compatible with Anukenese themselves.\n\
The Anukenese who get the fragment would improve mind. So they built the Terminal soon.\n\
What is more, they found that if several fragment gathered together and apply to Anukenese, they would be in infinite technical energy. \n\
They could even dominate the whole universe!\n\
In the end, they did not worry about colonizing planets, but continued finding more fragment.\n\
As the fragment was more and more, their technology upgraded faster and faster.\n\
They researched the Particle Collider, got the Creator Particle and produced a lot of Creator Energy Particle.\n\
Then the energy particle got fusion and craft the Creator Star that had the same energy, aptitude and frequency as the energy Fragment had. \n\
On that day, all Anukenese celebrated because they knew it is not far to become the creator of the universe.\n\
\n\
Then the Battle Anukenese beat more monsters, Controller, Shadow Hider and Ultimate \n\
Having researched the best weapon, Arker Shockwave, they killed the strongest Guardian.\n\
Anukenese called it World Devastator, and got many fragments from him.\n\
Other Researcher Anukenese immediately followed to get more Creator Star.\n\
After thar, Anukenese did their best to make one of them a Creator.\n\
But the Creator Anukenese noticed that his consciousness was not equal to the others.\n\
He was higher; he was in the others but the others were not in him. \n\
He could also see something not to see before.\n\
He saw a God Soul controlling the world.\n\
As turned out, the whole world was made by him.\n\
He cannot stand waiting a second, so he rushed to the Soul and fight with him.\n\
Using the unique power that was given when became the Creator, Nothingness, speed killed the God soul.\n\
Then he tried breaking the dimension by using the Nothingness, in order to ran away from the world cage.\n\
Suddenly, a atmosphere that brought a strongly danger suffused all the Surphlo......\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
[#d9acc3]Creator I:\n\
[#ffffff]It had been countless years since the last battle between God and Soul.\n\
Anukenese lived in Sino, which was infertile and poor.\n\
Because of the poorness, they could hardly get technical energy, just for live poorly forever.\n\
They could never get great again.\n\
But life is full of unexpected.\n\
When they were exploring a mechanical enemy base, they found a fragment that might be the energy fragment.\n\
Then they found that it was not the energy fragment but the Creator Fragment which is made of the body of Creator dead scattered in many planets.\n\
So what really happen to that battle?\n\
“[#fac195]\n\
At that time, as Creator were going to break the dimension by using the Nothingness, a strong energy come out and suffused all the Surphlo.\n\
The Creator knew that it wa just the main part of XVX God Soul beat by himself.\n\
XVX said:" You , who just got a Creator, just a ant which is stronger.\n\
    Biting off more than one can chew, how dare you?!"\n\
Then he clapped and Creator tried to defended, but failed.\n\
He died.\n\
After his dead, all the technical energy vanished to thin air.\n\
This might be caused by that Creator is higher than the other Anukenese.\n\
Anukenese without technical energy almost died, but a few fled to the present Sino by the Interplanetary Accelerator \n\
”[#ffffff]\n\
Anukenese got the Creator Fragment. Having extracted the energy inside, they became stronger and stronger.\n\
The Anukenese with Creator Fragment are higher than the others.\n\
They are called Mind Minister.\n\
They traveled through the nearby planets leaded by the Ministers.\n\
Then they came to another two planets, Bipal and Namei\n\
Technology was reborn. Everything seemed to be finest. \n\
As the technology were more developed, the fragment gotten were more and more.\n\
And more independent Ministers.\n\
Then they were not whole anymore.\n\
They attacked each other for resources.\n\
They developed more Creator in the world.\n\
Making the war more violent.\n\
Wars makes deaths.\n\
The creator are not immortal either.\n\
The death of the Creator would brought his reign to death.\n\
的Just like every coins have two sides, the death also made the other things.\n\
More Creator Fragment were launched in other planets.\n\
Therefore more Creator were being made.\n\
A vicious circle happened to Anukenese.\n\
But one day, a Creator did not lose his body after death.\n\
Because of a stone he got before.\n\
It absorbed some unknown energy of him.\n\
Still Alive.\n\
After absorbing, it fly to the universe purposely. \n\
Where will it arrive?\n\
\n\
[#d9acc3]Creator III: Journey \n\
[#ffffff]WIP now!
